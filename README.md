# Hardware-Accelerator-Design-for-LeNET
This repository contains my semester project work on designing hardware accelerator for Handwritten digit recognition model (LeNET).

The files contain design based on NexusS4 FPGA and simulation on Vivado. The model weight files were assumed to be available locally as a coe file.
